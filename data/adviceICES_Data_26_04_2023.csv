Fisheries-related mortality on wild salmon from all wild and mixed (hatchery–wild) rivers in the Gulf of Finland should be as low as possible. Most of the salmon in the Gulf of Finland are of reared origin. Measures to focus the fishing effort on reared salmon should be implemented.  Such measures could include seasonal regulations and/or relocation of coastal fisheries away from sites likely to be on the migration paths of Gulf of Finland wild salmon. Fin-clipping of reared salmon stocks in all countries would allow wild salmon to be distinguished from reared salmon; as well as helping to identify wild salmon locations and fisheries on wild salmon. Relocation of fisheries away from rivers and rivers mouths supporting wild or mixed stocks; should be maintained. Wild salmon returning to rivers should be protected from poaching.
